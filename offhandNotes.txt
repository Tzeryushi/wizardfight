INPUT:
	Create input setup after importing inputactions package
		?Question? - how to handle player created keybinds? How to handle multiplayer?
		Button Modifiers can be used for behaviors that require button combinations, like holding shift with other buttons to run
		Control schemes can be used to delineate between control types, such as desktop vs gamepad, etc
	Generate a class for the input controller
		Binding masks can be utilized can be used to obscure controls in different circumstances
		Creates abstractions for input events, can be used in a Command scheme
	Instantiate your new control class in your player script, making sure to assign it on Awake and enable/disable it on enable/disable
		This keeps the scheme from overlapping others
	Create subscriptions to events when they are triggered
	
	OR
	
	Create input setup, but add it to your player object instead of making a class
	Define controls per script basis, perfectly abstracted and doesn't require public methods
		must still instantiate input
	Capable of switching actions maps in the script, cannot do that dynamically with the generated class method
	
	
HIERARCHY:
	Entity (cruicial data and receives COMMAND strucutre)
		Wizard
			Player
				(Player Classes)
		(Enemies, non-wizard types)
	Effect
		Spell
		Ability
	InputHandler (COMMAND)
	
CONTROL HIERARCHY:
	Empty "Player" object(s) handle input through PlayerInput objects, which have actions maps for multiple scenarios
	Player bodies (using entity class) are instantiated later and utilize the command layer to receive abstracted controls via command, allowing for free switching of entities

Should projectiles have an interface? Better that than direct inheritance, I think
